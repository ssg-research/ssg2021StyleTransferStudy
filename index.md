## Generative Style Transfer

Recently developed new _**Style Transfer**_ techniques make it possible to take any input image and produce an output image in a specified style. With such style transfer techniques, we can, for example, make photos look like painting by classical artists, automatically colour black-and-white images, or transform selfies into cartoon-like characters.

In this study, you are going to evaluate style transformations using such techniques in two different settings:
- making photos look like Monet paintings, and
- making selfies look like anime characters

This study is NOT intended to test your ability to evaluate images. Its purpose is to tell us which transformations look good in your opinion.

### Monet Style

Claude Monet was a famous French impressionist painter ([read more at the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet)).
In this part of the study, you are going to evaluate style transformations that make photos look as if they were painted by Monet.

Below you can find 2 examples of images painted by Monet.

### Anime Style

Anime is a Japanese hand-drawn animation style known for its characteristic way of picturing people ([read more at the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)).
In this part of the study, you are going to evaluate style transformations that make people in the photos look as if they were anime characters.

Below you can find some examples of characters drawn in the animes style.
